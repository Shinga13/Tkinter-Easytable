# Tkinter-Easytable
This python class serves as table display module for the GUI-Interface Tkinter. Tkinter itself does not contain such a module; possibly the closest module functionality-wise is 
the tkk.Treeview module. This on the other side is bulky and user-unfriendly not mentioning that it's purpose is not to display tables but hierachical structures such as
directories. At the same time those issues are the goals this project tries to archieve: An easy to use module that provides a method of displaying tables specifically.

## Features
- horizontally and vertically scrollable, the heading is always visible
- a variety of styling functions capable of styling individual cells, rows, columns

## How-to-use
To use this module simply download the Easytable.py file and import it into your own python project. I recommend using one of the following ways:
- paste the Easytable.py file into the same folder as your own .py file. Use 
`from Easytable import Easytable` 
or 
`from Easytable import Easytable as X` with X 
being your preferred name as import statement
